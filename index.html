    <p>Cookies don't really handle this case well. For example, a user could be buying plane tickets in two different
        windows, using the same site. If the site used cookies to keep track of which ticket the user was buying, then
        as the user clicked from page to page in both windows, the ticket currently being purchased would "leak" from
        one window to the other, potentially causing the user to buy two tickets for the same flight without really noticing.</p>
